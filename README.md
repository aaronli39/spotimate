# Spotm8: Finding friends, powered by music 
Spotm8 is a web application powered by the Spotify API that aims to connect users based on their music preferences. Similar to Tinder, users can filter nearby music lovers with similar music preferences to them, or even find users across the country if distance isn't an issue. Users can view their personal Spotify data, such as their top tracks of all time, favorite artists, and their playlists. Likewise, once matched with another user, their Spotify profile becomes available to you as well, should they authorize Spotm8 to share.
